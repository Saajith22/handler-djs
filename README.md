## How to use?

1. Clone this github repo
2. Write `npm i` in the command line (Make sure you have node)
3. Once done, make a `.env` file, and write your bot's token and prefix like so:
```
token=TOKEN
prefix=PREFIX
```
4. Now, you can write `node .` in the command line, and the handler should work just fine!
